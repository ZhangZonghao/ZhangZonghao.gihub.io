##Item 1 - the first month

###1、Psychological course

  * Uneasy.  No sure whether take up the quota of PI,because I' from spcial Ph.D program,also don't know my tutor.
  
  * Warred.  Tsinghua is the best University of china. I'm afraid of that can't keep up pace with others.
  
  * Stabled.  I couldn‘t feel my heart is peace untill Teacher Ding told me that I can choise wilfully my tutor，who is in charge of student affair in life science acadamy of Tsinghua Uiversity. then I enter my faverate lab. talking with my best PI tutor. 
  
  * Pleasure.  Everything just likes my plain，The one thing left to do is work hard.
  
  * Happy.  Most people is good at me in my lab. mang research staff I wanted can be learned here, I joint a super good workplace, I see my everyday will not be wasted.
  
  * Litter nervous.   I taked part in professinal science report every week, attended class everyday, study knowledge and emperiment techniques every hours. THis live is my lift.
  
  * Miss. I begin to miss my famlies, my wife，babies and parents everytime when I leisure. 
  
 ###2、 study in Biosysthesis Lab.
 
 * I am delivered to C team, which work on application of fuctional bacterial culture. The principal is Ye. I followed Huang and Zhang to learn the laborotary regular and correlation techniques. 
 
 * As far as me, a lot of emperiment methods about life science become easy in this lab. In the past experience, for completing a set of study,I must go to many place to learn, and need find many researchers to help me solvering problem. So I'm sure coming here is ture option.
 
 * My teacher Dr. Chen talked with me about my research task: Looking for promoters induced by high density (OD>100); 2. Starting mode should be simple and economical (such as stable change starting, dissolved oxygen change starting, etc.). I feeled my teacher is very nice person, and very professional at biosysthensis and biomaterial field。I respect him very much.So I have to  get into my job as soon as possible, It's the real pressure and power sourse for me.
 
 * I like that sensation, which
